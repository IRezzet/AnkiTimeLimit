# AnkiTimeLimit
This is a playful Anki-Addon to learn more effectively while still being allowed to play.

In Anki you can learn all kinds of things using flash-cards. Sometimes this can become a little blunt. To motivate and encourage usself to learn and keep up the
concentration, we play games between learning sessions. There is the problem i am trying to tackle. 
We all know it, the game gets too fun, and learning wasnÂ´t funny or productive anyways, so we just keep playing and playing and neglect the working part.

My AddOn gives you the edge. You learn a bit and then you want to have a pause and play a game? No problem! just limit the time you want to play in the dropdown under the "Start leaning"-Button to one of the options and press the newly implemented "Need a Pause?"-Button right beneath the "Time-Limit"-field and your game of choice (in Beta tested only with HeroesIII) starts. When the time you set yourself is up, the game gives you two minutes to save your gamestate, and then it closes and you have to check ten Flashcards in Anki. Once you completed your learning session, you can start playing again and so on.

If you just want to play, of course you can always just start the game from outside of anki and you have no limitation (Thommy Shelby) at all.

Instructions will follow during coding progress.
